# A Framework for Computational Thought Process

## 1. Introduction

The Computational Thought Process framework aims to model cognition as an iterative pipeline of discrete cognitive steps. This framework represents thoughts as hierarchical trees of information encoded as latent tensors, which are processed and transformed through various stages. The primary goal is to create an AI system capable of internalizing information, contextualizing it, and articulating coherent responses.

Key concepts:

- Semantic Latents: Hierarchical representations of thoughts
- Thought Pipeline: A series of cognitive operations on Semantic Latents
- Internalization and Articulation: Core processes for enriching and expressing thoughts

The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing for future integration with deep learning models and adaptation to various cognitive tasks.

## 2. Core Components and Processes

### 2.1 Semantic Latents

Semantic Latents are the fundamental data structure in our framework, representing thoughts and their semantic relationships.

Structure:

```python
class SemanticNode:
    def __init__(self, content: str):
        self.content = content
        self.embedding = None
        self.children: List[SemanticNode] = []

class SemanticLatent:
    def __init__(self, root_content: str):
        self.root = SemanticNode(root_content)
```

Key features:

- Hierarchical organization of thoughts
- Integration of text content and vector embeddings
- Dynamic structure allowing for growth and adaptation

Operations:

- Adding new thoughts to the hierarchy
- Transforming existing thoughts
- Calculating semantic similarity between nodes

### 2.2 Thought Pipeline

The Thought Pipeline consists of three main stages: Input Processing, Internalization, and Articulation.

1. Input Processing:
   - Encode input text into an initial Semantic Latent
   - Generate embeddings for the input

2. Internalization:
   - Contemplate on the thought by enriching it with context
   - Inject relevant information from external knowledge sources
   - Iterate through the internalization process until a condition is met

3. Articulation:
   - Transform the internalized thought into a coherent output
   - Decode the Semantic Latent back into natural language text

Information flow:

```
Input Text -> Semantic Latent -> Enriched Semantic Latent -> Output Text
```

Cognitive operations:

- Think: A subprocess that iterates a thought latent
- Transform: Mathematical operations applied to latent tensors
- Context Lookup: Querying external knowledge bases

## 3. Implementation Framework

### 3.1 Data Structures and Algorithms

Representation of Semantic Latents:

- Tree-based structure with SemanticNode as the basic unit
- Each node contains text content and an embedding vector

Clustering and organization methods:

- Modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
- Root-Anchored HAC respecting the original thought as the top-level node
- Dynamic linkage criterion considering semantic similarity and depth

Key algorithms:

```python
def add_to_hierarchy(self, new_node: SemanticNode):
    best_parent = self._find_best_parent(self.root, new_node)
    best_parent.children.append(new_node)

def _find_best_parent(self, current_node: SemanticNode, new_node: SemanticNode) -> SemanticNode:
    if not current_node.children:
        return current_node
    
    similarities = [self._calculate_similarity(child, new_node) for child in current_node.children]
    most_similar_child = current_node.children[np.argmax(similarities)]
    
    if max(similarities) > self._calculate_similarity(current_node, new_node):
        return self._find_best_parent(most_similar_child, new_node)
    else:
        return current_node

def _calculate_similarity(self, node1: SemanticNode, node2: SemanticNode) -> float:
    return np.dot(node1.embedding, node2.embedding)
```

Centroid Movement approach:

- Calculate cluster centroids using density volume distribution
- Track centroid movements to analyze semantic shifts

### 3.2 Integration with AI/ML Models

Use of language models and embedding techniques:

- Leveraging LLMs for generating thought transformations
- Using embedding models (e.g., sentence transformers) for semantic representations

Integration points:

```python
from DevAgent.Utils.NatLang import load_chat_interface, load_embed_interface

chat = load_chat_interface()
embed = load_embed_interface()

def transform_thought(self, node: SemanticNode, directive: str) -> SemanticNode:
    prompt = f"Based on the following thought and directive, generate a new thought:\nThought: {node.content}\nDirective: {directive}"
    new_content = chat.chat(
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a thought transformer."},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    )
    new_node = SemanticNode(new_content)
    new_node.embedding = embed.embed(new_content)
    return new_node
```

Future considerations for deep learning integration:

- Developing custom architectures for handling dynamic-sized inputs
- Exploring graph neural networks or recursive neural networks for processing hierarchical structures

## 4. Applications and Future Directions

Potential use cases:

- Advanced language understanding and generation
- Contextual information retrieval systems
- Cognitive modeling for AI agents

Areas for further research and development:

- Refining the hierarchical organization algorithms
- Developing more sophisticated transformation techniques
- Exploring tensor-based representations for Semantic Latents
- Investigating methods for continuous learning and adaptation

## 5. Conclusion

The Framework for Computational Thought Process provides a flexible and powerful approach to modeling cognitive processes in AI systems. By representing thoughts as Semantic Latents and processing them through a structured pipeline, the framework enables complex reasoning and contextual understanding.

Key advantages:

- Hierarchical representation of semantic information
- Integration of symbolic and subsymbolic AI approaches
- Extensibility for future deep learning integration

As development continues, this framework has the potential to significantly advance the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in areas requiring nuanced understanding and generation of complex ideas.
