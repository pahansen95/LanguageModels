# Language Models Project: µLMs, Continuous Learning, and Swarms

## 1. Project Vision and Core Concepts

### 1.1. Overall Vision and Goals

The project aims to explore innovative approaches to deep learning language models, focusing on three interconnected concepts: Micro Language Models, Continuous Learning, and µLM Swarms. The primary goal is to capture these ideas, iterate upon them, and implement them to advance our understanding of language model capabilities and limitations.

Key objectives include:

- Developing small, efficient language models capable of running on consumer hardware
- Implementing a continuous learning framework inspired by human cognition
- Exploring the potential of coordinated swarms of micro language models

### 1.2. Micro Language Models (µLMs)

µLMs are extremely small transformer-based language models designed to be trained quickly on a single consumer GPU. The target size is approximately 1GB, allowing for inference on most small low-power consumer GPUs, with training requiring less than 32GB of VRAM.

The hypothesis driving this concept is that large-scale models may not be necessary to achieve "intelligent" results. µLMs will focus on "problem-solving," aiming to discover responses through iteration at inference time rather than relying solely on learned knowledge.

### 1.3. Continuous Learning

The Continuous Learning approach is inspired by human intelligence and cognition. It envisions a closed-loop system where the model:

- Observes and interacts with its environment (the "world")
- Takes actions using provided "tools"
- Receives timely feedback based on its actions
- Adapts its internal world model based on the feedback

This approach aims to mimic how humans learn and adapt from their interactions, with the potential for a teacher or guide to help the model improve its performance over time.

### 1.4. µLM Swarms

The µLM Swarms concept involves using multiple µLM instances as part of a coordinated group of "intelligent agents." These swarms would be given a common goal or imperative and would "search" for answers or solutions. Key aspects include:

- Individual µLMs learning and adapting based on their actions and feedback
- A larger system or model guiding or controlling the swarm
- Inter-model communication, potentially using natural language
- Integration of human oversight and orchestration, especially during development

## 2. Technical Overview and Implementation Strategy

### 2.1. µLM Architecture and Constraints

- Size constraints: ~1GB for inference, <32GB VRAM for training
- Focus on efficiency and problem-solving capabilities
- Potential for custom architecture development based on the transformer model

### 2.2. Continuous Learning Framework

- Representation of the "world" and available "tools" for model interaction
- Implementation of feedback mechanisms
- Balance between exploration and exploitation in the learning process

### 2.3. Swarm Coordination and Large Model Integration

- Methods for aggregating and interpreting outputs from multiple µLMs
- Role of a larger, guiding language model in coordinating the swarm
- Algorithms or techniques for managing swarm behavior

### 2.4. Key Implementation Steps

#### 2.4.1. Building the µLM

- Start with a small version of an existing architecture (e.g., GPT-2 small)
- Experiment with compression techniques like pruning or quantization
- Iteratively develop and refine the architecture

#### 2.4.2. Developing Programmatic Access

- Create a clean API for both training and inference
- Consider using existing frameworks like Hugging Face's Transformers as a starting point

#### 2.4.3. Training Data and "Thinking" Framework

- Utilize existing datasets (e.g., WikiText, BookCorpus) for language training
- Develop data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines
- Research and implement a framework for teaching the model "how to think"
- Start with simple problem-solving tasks and gradually increase complexity

#### 2.4.4. World System Model and Harness

- Begin with a simple, text-based world model
- Implement basic actions and clear feedback mechanisms
- Gradually increase complexity as the approach is refined

## 3. Challenges and Next Steps

### 3.1. Research Questions and Technical Challenges

- Balancing model size with performance
