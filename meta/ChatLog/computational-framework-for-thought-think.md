I've implemented SemanticLatents. I'm now ready to begin implementing the pipeline. Before we implement anything, can you help me think through design of the pipeline. My goals are:

- Implement a minimal executable pipeline focusing on fast iterative development.
- Use the existing `SemanticLatent` as a standin for the eventual DeepLearning based Standin.
- Leverage LLMs where there is a need to transform Semantic Information. Do not use LLMs to "take action" or where traditional computational algorithms already exist.

Walk me through your thought process on how we can design the pipeline.

Context: The user has implemented SemanticLatents and is ready to design a pipeline.
User expectations: A thoughtful design approach for a minimal, executable pipeline that can be iteratively developed.
Relevant implicit knowledge: Software design principles, pipeline architecture, LLM integration, and the concept of SemanticLatents.
Key takeaways: Pipeline components, data flow, integration points for SemanticLatents and LLMs, and considerations for future expansion.
Information ordering: 1) High-level pipeline structure, 2) Key components and their roles, 3) Data flow and transformations, 4) LLM integration points, 5) Considerations for future deep learning integration.

Let's design a minimal, executable pipeline that meets your goals. We'll focus on a modular structure that allows for fast iterative development and easy integration of SemanticLatents and LLMs.

1. High-level pipeline structure:
   - Input → Preprocessing → Semantic Processing → Transformation → Output
   This structure allows for clear separation of concerns and easy addition or modification of components.

2. Key components and their roles:
   a. Input Handler: Receives and validates input data.
   b. Preprocessor: Prepares data for semantic processing.
   c. SemanticLatent Generator: Creates SemanticLatent representations.
   d. Transformer: Applies semantic transformations using LLMs when necessary.
   e. Output Generator: Produces the final output based on transformed data.

3. Data flow and transformations:
   - Input text → Preprocessed text → SemanticLatent → Transformed SemanticLatent → Output text
   Each step should be implemented as a separate function or class for modularity.

4. LLM integration points:
   - Primarily in the Transformer component for semantic transformations.
   - Potentially in the Preprocessor for advanced text preparation.
   - Consider an LLM Router to determine when LLM use is necessary.

5. Considerations for future deep learning integration:
   - Design interfaces that can be easily swapped with deep learning models.
   - Use abstract base classes for key components to allow for different implementations.

Here's a pseudo-code outline to illustrate this design:

```python
class Pipeline:
    def __init__(self, input_handler, preprocessor, semantic_generator, transformer, output_generator):
        self.input_handler = input_handler
        self.preprocessor = preprocessor
        self.semantic_generator = semantic_generator
        self.transformer = transformer
        self.output_generator = output_generator

    def process(self, input_data):
        validated_input = self.input_handler.validate(input_data)
        preprocessed_data = self.preprocessor.process(validated_input)
        semantic_latent = self.semantic_generator.generate(preprocessed_data)
        transformed_latent = self.transformer.transform(semantic_latent)
        return self.output_generator.generate(transformed_latent)

class LLMRouter:
    def should_use_llm(self, data):
        # Logic to determine if LLM should be used
        pass

class Transformer:
    def __init__(self, llm_router, llm_client):
        self.llm_router = llm_router
        self.llm_client = llm_client

    def transform(self, semantic_latent):
        if self.llm_router.should_use_llm(semantic_latent):
            return self.llm_client.transform(semantic_latent)
        else:
            return self.traditional_transform(semantic_latent)

    def traditional_transform(self, semantic_latent):
        # Implement traditional computational algorithms
        pass
```

This design allows you to:
1. Quickly implement a working pipeline using your existing SemanticLatent.
2. Easily replace components as you develop more advanced implementations.
3. Integrate LLMs selectively, focusing on semantic transformations.
4. Prepare for future deep learning integration by using modular, swappable components.

What aspects of this design would you like to explore further or modify to better fit your specific needs?

Okay let's focus on the Think Pipeline. How did we define `Thinking` to work in the Framework?

<meta hidden k=strat>
Context: We need to recall and focus on the 'Think' pipeline as defined in the Computational Thought Framework.
User expectations: A clear explanation of how 'Thinking' was defined to work in the framework.
Relevant implicit knowledge: The Computational Thought Framework documentation, concepts of cognitive processes in AI.
Key takeaways: The structure and functioning of the Think pipeline, its components, and how it processes Semantic Latents.
Information ordering: 1) Definition of 'Thinking', 2) Components of the Think pipeline, 3) How it processes Semantic Latents, 4) Its role in the larger framework.
</meta>

Based on the Computational Thought Framework, the 'Think' pipeline was defined as follows:

1. Definition of 'Thinking':
   'Thinking' is modeled as an iterative process that operates on Semantic Latents. It's a subprocess within the larger Thought Pipeline, designed to enrich and transform thoughts represented as Semantic Latents.

2. Components of the Think pipeline:
   The Think pipeline is part of the Internalization stage and consists of:
   a) A 'Contemplate' operation
   b) A context injection step

3. Processing of Semantic Latents:
   - The Think pipeline takes a Semantic Latent as input.
   - It applies the 'Contemplate' operation, which likely involves analyzing and enriching the latent representation.
   - Then it injects relevant context, potentially from external knowledge sources.
   - This process iterates until a certain condition is met (though the specific condition isn't detailed in the provided context).

4. Role in the larger framework:
   - The Think pipeline is a core component of the Internalization stage.
   - It's responsible for enriching the initial thought (represented as a Semantic Latent) with context and deeper consideration.
   - The output of this pipeline feeds into the Articulation stage, where the enriched thought is transformed into a coherent output.

In the code, the Think pipeline is represented as a subclass of Pipeline:

```python
class Think(Pipeline[latent_t]):
    """A (SubPipeline) to Think on some latent"""
    
    def __init__(self, cognition: str) -> None:
        super().__init__(
            [
                ... # TODO
            ]
        )
```

The `cognition` parameter suggests that different types of thinking processes might be implemented, though the details aren't provided in the current implementation.

To implement this pipeline, we'd need to focus on:
1. Defining the 'Contemplate' operation
2. Implementing the context injection step
3. Determining the iteration condition
4. Ensuring the output is a transformed Semantic Latent

How would you like to approach implementing these components of the Think pipeline?
