I have concluded initial brainstorming for a framework describing `Computational Thought Process` for an intelligent agent. To provide a high level description of the framework:

> The Compuational Thought Process models cognition as an iterative pipeline of discrete cognitive steps. The thought, modeled as hierarchical trees of information encoded as a latent tensor, is passed to each step in the pipeline & transformed. Each step is a cyclic lop that breaks on a per step evaluation.

The Framework currently consists of 2 primary processes:

1. Internalize: Enrich the initial thought w/ Context; Further contemplate on this enriched thought.
2. Articulate: Produce a fluent & coherent thought to be shared with external parties.

The Pipeline of the framework is broken down into the following components:

1. Some Input is encoded into an initial semantic `latent` which can be considered the agent's perception of the input (aka a `thought`).
2. The `thought` is then internalized:
  a. The Agent `Contemplates` on the thought.
  b. `Context` is injected into the thought if it's available: Semantically similiar information & knowledge returned from an external `lookup`.
  c. The `thought` is looped through this subprocess until some condtion is met (such as a time bound or hueristic based threshold).
  d. The `thought` undergoes one final contemplative `think` step.
3. The `internalized thought` is then Articulated:
  a. We `think` about how to articulate a response to the input, in a loop until some break condition is met (such as a time bound or hueristic based threshold).
4. The `articulated thought` is then decoded to be sent to some other system or agent.

To better articulate terms & ideas:

- `think` is a subprocess that iterates a `thought` latent:
  1. Frame or contextualize the `thought` within the agent's current world view (trained/internal/implicit knowledge)
  2. Recall any related experiences & (implicit/internal) knowledge.
  3. `Transform` the thought (A Learned process)
  4. Calculate the Diff from the starting & ending `thought`; a diff ~0 (should) implies "I Don't Know"
- `transform`: Some mathematical function/process applied to a latent (Tensor).
- `context lookup`: Querying an external knowledge base for relevant information.
- `encode/decode`: To un/marshal some externally formatted message (usually Natural Language Text) from/to a Semantic Latent for the pipeline.

I have also provided some preliminary impelmentation. My project goals are to A) implement the minimal amount necessary to have an executable pipeline for fast, iterative development; B) evaluate & refine the framework; C) train DeepLearning Models to provide certain functionality not otherwise possible w/ traditional computational algorithms; D) hook up this system w/ a harness to interact w/ the a "world".

Please review the framework & it's current implementation. Provider me your PoV on how we can iterate towards my goals.

Your Computational Thought Process framework presents an intriguing approach to modeling cognition. Let's analyze it and discuss how to iterate towards your goals:

1. Framework Analysis:
   - The pipeline structure is logical and mirrors human cognitive processes.
   - The distinction between Internalize and Articulate is valuable for separating input processing from output generation.
   - The concept of "thoughts" as latent tensors is promising for representing complex, hierarchical information.

2. Implementation Review:
   - The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the pipeline structure.
   - The use of async functions and generators allows for flexible, non-blocking execution.
   - The modular design (e.g., separate Internalize and Articulate classes) facilitates iterative development.

3. Iteration Strategy:
   - Implement minimal versions of each component to create an end-to-end pipeline.
   - Focus on the core "think" subprocess, as it's central to the framework's functionality.
   - Develop simple heuristics for break conditions in cyclic processes.
   - Create a basic external knowledge base for context lookup.

4. Prioritized Recommendations:
   a) Implement a basic "transform" function for the "think" subprocess.
   b) Develop a simple context lookup mechanism using a key-value store or embedding-based retrieval.
   c) Create a minimal world model for testing agent interactions.
   d) Implement basic encode/decode functions for natural language input/output.
   e) Develop metrics to evaluate the quality and coherence of generated thoughts.

To advance your project efficiently, consider the following approach:

1. Implement a minimally functional pipeline using placeholder functions for complex operations (e.g., "transform").
2. Focus on one subprocess at a time, starting with "think", as it's core to your framework.
3. Use simple, rule-based implementations initially, then gradually introduce machine learning models.
4. Develop a suite of test cases to validate each component's functionality.

How do you envision the interaction between the agent and the "world" harness? This could inform the design of your encode/decode functions and guide the development of your world model.
