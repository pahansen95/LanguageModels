I have concluded initial brainstorming for a framework describing `Computational Thought Process` for an intelligent agent. To provide a high level description of the framework:

> The Compuational Thought Process models the cognitive action of thinking. Thoughts, modeled as hierarchical trees of information, are propogated through a pipeline of cognitive steps. At each step in the process, a thought is iterated: the current thought is input into the step's "function" & some transformed thought is output. Steps represent other frameworks or processes (ex. Contextualize, Recall) that work to modify or otherwise augment the thought; some steps are traditionally computable (ie. an algorithm), while others are learned through machine learning.

The Framework consists of 2 primary processes:

1. Internalize: Iteratively enrich an initial thought w/ Context & Contemplate the new information relative to the original thought.
2. Articulate: Iteratively formulate a response to the initial thought. 

The process involves iterating `thoughts` (Latents of Semantic Information) through a pipeline:

1. Some Input, a prompt (as raw text), is encoded into an initial semantic latent which can be considered the agent's perception of the input (aka a `thought`).
2. The `thought` is then internalized:
  a. We `think` about it.
  b. Next, we inject semantic `context` based on information & knowledge from an external `lookup` (if available).
  c. We loop the `thought` through this process until some condtion is met (such as a time bound or hueristic based threshold).
  d. conduct one final `think`
3. The `internalized thought` is then Articulated:
  a. We `think` about how to articulate a response to the input, in a loop until some break condition is met (such as a time bound or hueristic based threshold).
4. The `articulated thought` is then decoded back into it's Output Format (ie. Raw Text) as the response.

To define some terms:

- `think` is a subprocess that iterates a `thought` latent:
  1. Frame or contextualize the `thought` within the agent's current world view (trained/internal/implicit knowledge)
  2. Recall any related experiences & (implicit/internal) knowledge.
  3. `Transform` the thought (A Learned process)
  4. Calculate the Diff from the starting & ending `thought`; a diff ~0 (should) implies "I Don't Know"
- `transform`: Some mathematical function/process applied to a latent (Tensor).
- `context lookup`: Querying an external knowledge base for relevant information.

Currently this is all I have. I need help contemplating the framework, it's implications, design & then work on iterating it.

Your framework for Computational Thought Process is intriguing and shows potential. Let's analyze it critically:

1. Framework Structure:
   - The hierarchical thought model aligns with cognitive science theories
   - The pipeline approach allows for modular development and testing
   - Separation of Internalize and Articulate processes is logical

2. Strengths and Limitations:
   Strengths:
   - Incorporates both algorithmic and learned processes
   - Iterative nature allows for refinement of thoughts
   - Inclusion of external knowledge lookup enhances adaptability

   Potential Limitations:
   - May oversimplify complex cognitive processes
   - Unclear how to handle conflicting information or uncertainty
   - Potentially computationally intensive for real-time applications

3. Suggested Improvements:
   - Define metrics for evaluating thought quality and process efficiency
   - Incorporate a mechanism for handling ambiguity and conflicting information
   - Consider adding a meta-cognitive layer for self-evaluation and learning

4. Next Steps:
   - Formalize the mathematical representation of 'thoughts' as latents
   - Develop specific algorithms for the 'think' and 'transform' processes
   - Design experiments to validate the framework against human cognition

How do you envision implementing the 'transform' function? This seems crucial for the framework's effectiveness.

I'm not super sure how exactly `transform` would be implemented; my initial thought is a Linear Transformation (The Assumption is that the `thought` is encoded as some Tensor).

Context: Discussing implementation of 'transform' function in Computational Thought Process framework
User expectations: Elaboration on the Linear Transformation idea and potential alternatives
My knowledge: Linear algebra, neural network architectures, and tensor operations

Outline:
1. Evaluate linear transformation approach
2. Propose alternative transformation methods
3. Discuss trade-offs and considerations
4. Suggest next steps for implementation
</meta>

Your initial thought of using a Linear Transformation for the `transform` function is a reasonable starting point. Let's analyze this approach and consider alternatives:

1. Linear Transformation:
   - Pros: Simple, computationally efficient, well-understood mathematically
   - Cons: May lack expressiveness for complex thought transformations

2. Alternative approaches:
   a. Non-linear transformations (e.g., applying activation functions)
   b. Attention mechanisms (similar to those in transformer models)
   c. Convolutional operations (if spatial relationships in thoughts are relevant)
   d. Recurrent neural network cells (for capturing sequential dependencies)

3. Trade-offs to consider:
   - Computational complexity vs. expressiveness
   - Interpretability vs. black-box behavior
   - Ease of training vs. potential for overfitting

4. Implementation steps:
   - Define the exact structure of the thought tensor
   - Experiment with different transformation types
   - Develop metrics to evaluate transformation effectiveness

Given the complexity of thought processes, a combination of these approaches might be most effective. For example, you could use a non-linear transformation followed by an attention mechanism.

How do you plan to represent the structure of the thought tensor? This will significantly influence the choice of transformation method.

Let me better articulate a more guided direction for this conversation.

I want to iterate on this framework but based on observational feedback. To do that I need to A) Implement the framework & B) Use the Framework.

Let's focus on implementation. I'll give you my thoughts:

- The high level process itself can be a data pipeline implemented in Python.
- Each major step in the process can also be a data pipeline.
- Each minor step in the process can be some concrete implementation or another pipeline.
- For "learned" steps, I want to use DeepLearning via PyTorch.
- For "Algorithmic" steps, I'll implement that using Python just like any other Computational Algorithm.

Context: Implementing the Computational Thought Process framework
User expectations: Guidance on implementation strategy using Python, data pipelines, and PyTorch
My knowledge: Python programming, data pipeline architectures, PyTorch, and deep learning concepts
Key takeaways: Provide a structured approach to implementation, focusing on modularity and scalability
Outline:
1. Overall architecture design
2. Data pipeline implementation
3. PyTorch integration for learned steps
4. Algorithmic step implementation
5. Testing and iteration strategy
</meta>

Your implementation strategy is sound and aligns well with modern software engineering practices. Let's break down the implementation approach:

1. Overall Architecture:
   - Use a modular design pattern (e.g., Factory or Strategy) for step implementations
   - Implement a base `Pipeline` class for reusability across major and minor steps
   - Define clear interfaces for thought input/output between steps

2. Data Pipeline Implementation:
   - Utilize Python's generator functions for efficient data flow
   - Consider using libraries like `itertools` for pipeline operations
   - Implement pipeline stages as separate classes for modularity

3. PyTorch Integration:
   - Create a `LearnedStep` base class that integrates with PyTorch models
   - Use PyTorch's `nn.Module` as a basis for learned transformations
   - Implement data conversions between pipeline format and PyTorch tensors

4. Algorithmic Step Implementation:
   - Develop an `AlgorithmicStep` base class for non-learned steps
   - Implement specific algorithms as subclasses of `AlgorithmicStep`
   - Ensure consistent input/output formats with learned steps

5. Testing and Iteration:
   - Implement unit tests for individual steps and integration tests for pipelines
   - Use PyTorch's built-in tools for model evaluation and optimization
   - Create a benchmarking system to compare different implementations

Here's a basic structure to start with:

```python
import torch
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Step(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, thought):
        pass

class Pipeline:
    def __init__(self, steps):
        self.steps = steps
    
    def run(self, initial_thought):
        for step in self.steps:
            initial_thought = step.process(initial_thought)
        return initial_thought

class LearnedStep(Step):
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = torch.nn.Module()  # Define your PyTorch model here
    
    def process(self, thought):
        # Convert thought to PyTorch tensor, process, and convert back
        pass

class AlgorithmicStep(Step):
    def process(self, thought):
        # Implement algorithmic transformation
        pass

# Example usage
internalize_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ContextLookup(),
    LearnedThink(),
    AlgorithmicTransform()
])

articulate_pipeline = Pipeline([
    LearnedArticulate(),
    FormatOutput()
])

main_pipeline = Pipeline([
    EncodeInput(),
    internalize_pipeline,
    articulate_pipeline,
    DecodeOutput()
])

result = main_pipeline.run(initial_input)
```

This structure allows for easy expansion and modification of the framework. What specific part of this implementation would you like to focus on first?

Let's go ahead & implement the top level pipeline. I've implemented a basic skeleton in `LanguageModels.ComputationalThoughts` to get us started.

Context: Implementing the top-level pipeline for the Computational Thought Process
User expectations: Build upon the existing skeleton in LanguageModels.ComputationalThoughts
My knowledge: Python async programming, generator-based pipelines, and the provided skeleton code
Key takeaways: Enhance the existing Pipeline class, implement specific steps, and create a functional top-level pipeline
Outline:
1. Review and enhance the existing Pipeline class
2. Implement specific pipeline steps
3. Create the top-level pipeline

5. Suggest testing strategy
</meta>

Excellent, let's build upon the skeleton you've provided in `LanguageModels.ComputationalThoughts`. I'll enhance the Pipeline class and implement the top-level pipeline for the Computational Thought Process.

1. Enhancing the Pipeline class:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import Any, AsyncIterator, List
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Pipeline:
    def __init__(self, steps: List[callable]) -> None:
        self.steps = steps
    
    def __aiter__(self) -> AsyncIterator:
        return self
    
    async def __anext__(self) -> Any:
        return await self.step(None)  # Start with None as initial input
    
    async def step(self, input: Any) -> Any:
        for step in self.steps:
            try:
                input = await step(input)
                logger.debug(f"Step {step.__name__} completed")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error in step {step.__name__}: {str(e)}")
                raise
        return input
```

2. Implementing specific pipeline steps:

```python
async def encode_input(input: str) -> dict:
    return {"raw": input, "encoded": input.encode()}  # Placeholder encoding

async def internalize(thought: dict) -> dict:
    # Placeholder for internalization process
    thought["internalized"] = True
    return thought

async def articulate(thought: dict) -> dict:
    # Placeholder for articulation process
    thought["articulated"] = thought.get("raw", "") + " (articulated)"
    return thought

async def decode_output(thought: dict) -> str:
    return thought.get("articulated", "")
```

3. Creating the top-level pipeline:

```python
async def create_computational_thought_pipeline() -> Pipeline:
    return Pipeline([
        encode_input,
        internalize,
        articulate,
        decode_output
    ])
```

4. Using the pipeline:

```python
async def process_thought(input: str) -> str:
    pipeline = await create_computational_thought_pipeline()
    async for result in pipeline:
        if result is not None:
            return result
    return "No result produced"

async def main():
    input_thought = "What is the meaning of life?"
    result = await process_thought(input_thought)
    print(f"Input: {input_thought}")
    print(f"Output: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

This implementation provides a basic structure for the top-level pipeline. Each step is implemented as an async function, allowing for potential I/O operations or complex processing without blocking.

5. Testing strategy:

- Unit tests for each pipeline step
- Integration tests for the entire pipeline
- Stress tests with various inputs to ensure robustness
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., for context lookup) to isolate pipeline behavior

Next steps could include:
1. Implementing more detailed versions of each step (e.g., actual encoding/decoding, internalization, and articulation processes)
2. Adding error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. Implementing a more sophisticated thought representation (e.g., using PyTorch tensors)
4. Integrating external knowledge bases for the internalization step

Would you like to focus on any specific part of this implementation or move on to more detailed implementations of individual steps?

Context: Implementing Internalize and Articulate as sub-pipelines in the Computational Thought Process
User expectations: Detailed mock-up of Internalize and Articulate sub-pipelines

5. Suggest potential enhancements
</meta>

Certainly! Let's implement Internalize and Articulate as sub-pipelines within our main Computational Thought Process pipeline. We'll create mock-ups for each sub-pipeline, maintaining the async structure and modularity.

1. Internalize Sub-Pipeline:

```python
async def think(thought: dict) -> dict:
    thought["processed"] = thought.get("processed", []) + ["thought"]
    return thought

async def context_lookup(thought: dict) -> dict:
    # Simulating an external context lookup
    thought["context"] = "Some relevant context"
    return thought

async def contemplate(thought: dict) -> dict:
    thought["processed"] = thought.get("processed", []) + ["contemplated"]
    return thought

class Internalize(Pipeline):
    def __init__(self, max_iterations: int = 3):
        super().__init__([
            think,
            context_lookup,
            contemplate
        ])
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
    
    async def step(self, input: Any) -> Any:
        for _ in range(self.max_iterations):
            input = await super().step(input)
            if self._should_stop(input):
                break
        return input
    
    def _should_stop(self, thought: dict) -> bool:
        # Implement your stopping condition here
        return len(thought.get("processed", [])) >= self.max_iterations * 3
```

2. Articulate Sub-Pipeline:

```python
async def formulate_response(thought: dict) -> dict:
    thought["response"] = f"Formulated response based on {thought.get('processed', [])}"
    return thought

async def refine_response(thought: dict) -> dict:
    thought["response"] = f"Refined: {thought.get('response', '')}"
    return thought

class Articulate(Pipeline):
    def __init__(self, max_iterations: int = 2):
        super().__init__([
            think,
            formulate_response,
            refine_response
        ])
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
    
    async def step(self, input: Any) -> Any:
        for _ in range(self.max_iterations):
            input = await super().step(input)
            if self._should_stop(input):
                break
        return input
    
    def _should_stop(self, thought: dict) -> bool:
        # Implement your stopping condition here
        return "response" in thought and len(thought["response"]) > 50
```

3. Integrating Sub-Pipelines into Main Pipeline:

```python
async def create_computational_thought_pipeline() -> Pipeline:
    return Pipeline([
        encode_input,
        Internalize(max_iterations=3),
        Articulate(max_iterations=2),
        decode_output
    ])
```

4. Example Usage and Flow:

```python
async def process_thought(input: str) -> str:
    pipeline = await create_computational_thought_pipeline()
    thought = {"raw": input}
    async for result in pipeline:
        thought = await pipeline.step(thought)
    return thought.get("response", "No response generated")

async def main():
    input_thought = "What is the meaning of life?"
    result = await process_thought(input_thought)
    print(f"Input: {input_thought}")
    print(f"Output: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

5. Potential Enhancements:

- Implement more sophisticated stopping conditions for sub-pipelines
- Add error handling and recovery mechanisms within sub-pipelines
- Introduce parallel processing for certain steps (e.g., context lookup)
- Implement a more detailed thought representation (e.g., using nested dictionaries or custom classes)
- Add logging and debugging information for each step in the sub-pipelines

This implementation provides a modular structure for the Internalize and Articulate sub-pipelines, allowing for easy modification and extension of each process. The sub-pipelines can iterate multiple times, simulating deeper thought processes, while still fitting seamlessly into the main pipeline structure.

Would you like to focus on implementing any specific part of these sub-pipelines in more detail, or shall we move on to integrating them with actual NLP models or external knowledge bases?

<meta hidden k=strat>
Context: Review and refine the current pipeline implementation for iterative usage
User expectations: Identify areas for improvement and suggest refinements
My knowledge: Async Python, generator-based pipelines, and the provided implementation
Key takeaways: Enhance pipeline flexibility, improve error handling, and optimize for iterative use
Outline:
1. Review current implementation
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Suggest refinements
4. Provide code examples for key changes
5. Discuss potential impact and next steps
</meta>

After reviewing your current implementation, I can suggest several refinements to enhance its flexibility and suitability for iterative usage:

1. Input Injection:
   Your current `__anext__` method always starts with `None`. For more flexibility, allow input injection:

   ```python
   class Pipeline:
       def __init__(self, steps: list) -> None:
           self.steps = steps
           self.input = None
       
       def __call__(self, input: T) -> Pipeline[T]:
           self.input = input
           return self
       
       async def __anext__(self) -> T:
           if self.input is None:
               raise StopAsyncIteration
           result = await self.step(self.input)
           self.input = None  # Reset for next iteration
           return result
   ```

2. Error Handling:
   Implement more robust error handling within the `step` method:

   ```python
   async def step(self, input: T) -> T:
       for step in self.steps:
           try:
               input = await step(input)
           except Exception as e:
               logger.error(f"Error in step {step.__name__}: {str(e)}")
               raise PipelineStepError(step.__name__, str(e)) from e
       return input
   ```

3. Flexibility in Step Definition:
   Allow steps to be either async functions or Pipeline instances:

   ```python
   async def step(self, input: T) -> T:
       for step in self.steps:
           if isinstance(step, Pipeline):
               input = await step.step(input)
           else:
               input = await step(input)
       return input
   ```

4. Progress Tracking:
   Add a mechanism to track progress through the pipeline:

   ```python
   class Pipeline:
       def __init__(self, steps: list) -> None:
           self.steps = steps
           self.current_step = 0
       
       async def step(self, input: T) -> T:
           for i, step in enumerate(self.steps[self.current_step:], self.current_step):
               input = await self._execute_step(step, input)
               self.current_step = i + 1
           self.current_step = 0  # Reset for next iteration
           return input
       
       async def _execute_step(self, step, input):
           # Implementation as before
   ```

5. Pause and Resume:
   Implement functionality to pause and resume pipeline execution:

   ```python
   class Pipeline:
       def __init__(self, steps: list) -> None:
           self.steps = steps
           self.current_step = 0
           self.paused = False
       
       async def step(self, input: T) -> T:
           while self.current_step < len(self.steps) and not self.paused:
               step = self.steps[self.current_step]
               input = await self._execute_step(step, input)
               self.current_step += 1
           if self.current_step >= len(self.steps):
               self.current_step = 0  # Reset for next iteration
           return input
       
       def pause(self):
           self.paused = True
       
       def resume(self):
           self.paused = False
   ```

These refinements would make your pipeline more flexible and suitable for iterative usage. They allow for input injection, better error handling, progress tracking, and the ability to pause and resume execution.

To implement these changes:

1. Update the `Pipeline` class with the new methods and attributes.
2. Modify the `think` function in your CLI to use the new input injection method:

   ```python
   async def think(prompt: str) -> str:
       pipeline = Pipeline([
           encode,
           Internalize([...]),
           Articulate([...]),
           decode,
       ])
       
       result = None
       async for resp in pipeline(prompt):
           result = resp
           logger.info(resp)
       return result
   ```

These changes would allow for more controlled and flexible pipeline execution, better suited for iterative and potentially interactive use cases. They also provide a foundation for more advanced features like step-by-step debugging or dynamic pipeline modification.

Would you like to focus on implementing any of these specific refinements, or shall we discuss how to integrate these changes into your existing codebase?

Please consult the Context & review my latest implementation of the `ComputationalThoughts` Module.

I'm at a point where I need to start implementing the individual bits of the framework. Here's what I could specifically start implementing:

- Encoding/Decoding of Latents
- The `Thinking` process
- the `lookup` process

Thinking big picture, I want to train DeepLearning Models to implement single parts of the process. Training is a rather large prereq for the DL-based implementations so it would probably make sense to first focus on implementing these features using existing LLMs & LLM Tools where possible.

I guess right now I'm experiencing analysis paralysis & I'm not making a decision on what to do; part of this might be b/c I'm currently thinking at such a high level I'm not able to project onto the actual steps to complete. So I should just pick one & start implementing it as best I can to jump start the process.

Help me think through this & provide me persepctive so I can better make a decision.

After reviewing your latest implementation of the ComputationalThoughts module, I understand your position. Let's break this down to help you move forward:

1. Current State:
   You have a solid pipeline structure that can handle the flow of "thoughts" through various processing steps. This is a great foundation.

2. Potential Next Steps:
   - Encoding/Decoding of Latents
   - Implementing the "Thinking" process
   - Developing the "lookup" process
   - Integrating existing LLMs for rapid prototyping

3. Prioritization:
   Given your goal to start seeing results and the complexity of training custom models, I suggest this order:

   1. Implement "lookup" process
   2. Use existing LLMs for the "Thinking" process
   3. Develop basic Encoding/Decoding

   This order allows you to start seeing results quickly while building towards your long-term goals.

4. Concrete Action Plan:

   a. Implement "lookup" process:
      - Start with a simple key-value store or database for context
      - Implement a function that takes a thought and returns relevant context
      - This could be as simple as keyword matching initially

   b. Use existing LLMs for "Thinking":
      - Integrate an API for an existing LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 or Hugging Face's models)
      - Create prompts that guide the LLM to perform the "thinking" step
      - Implement this as a step in your pipeline

   c. Basic Encoding/Decoding:
      - Start with a simple text-to-vector encoding (e.g., using pre-trained word embeddings)
      - Implement functions to convert between text and these vector representations

5. Perspective:
   Remember, perfect is the enemy of good. Start with simple implementations and iterate. This approach will:
   - Provide quick feedback on your framework's effectiveness
   - Allow you to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement
   - Give you a working system to build upon

Here's a snippet to get you started with the "lookup" process:

```python
import sqlite3
from typing import Dict, Any

class ContextLookup:
    def __init__(self, db_path: str):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        self.cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS context
                              (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)''')

    def add_context(self, key: str, value: str):
        self.cursor.execute("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO context VALUES (?, ?)", (key, value))
        self.conn.commit()

    async def lookup(self, thought: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        keywords = thought.get('keywords', [])
        context = []
        for keyword in keywords:
            self.cursor.execute("SELECT value FROM context WHERE key LIKE ?", (f"%{keyword}%",))
            results = self.cursor.fetchall()
            context.extend([r[0] for r in results])
        thought['context'] = context
        return thought

# Usage in pipeline
lookup = ContextLookup('path_to_your_db.sqlite')
pipeline = Pipeline([
    encode_input,
    lookup.lookup,
    think,
    articulate,
    decode_output
])
```

This gives you a starting point for the lookup process. You can populate the database with relevant information and expand the lookup logic as needed.

Next, you could focus on integrating an existing LLM for the "think" step. This will give you a functional pipeline to experiment with and refine.

Remember, the goal is to start implementing and iterating. Each step will provide insights for the next, helping you refine your approach and overcome the analysis paralysis.

Would you like to start with implementing this lookup process, or do you prefer to begin with one of the other steps?

Actually, I'm planning to reuse Semantic Search Functionality I implemented for my KnowledgeBase. However, right now the gap there is I don't have nearly enough world data to be useful. I need to iterate further on that but it's not particularly easy to do so.

What else?

Given that you already have Semantic Search functionality and the current limitation is the lack of sufficient world data, let's shift our focus to other aspects of your Computational Thought Process that we can implement and iterate on quickly. Here are some alternative next steps:

1. Implement the "Thinking" process:
   This is a core component of your framework and can be prototyped using existing LLMs. It doesn't require extensive world data and can provide immediate value.

2. Develop Encoding/Decoding of Latents:
   This is fundamental to your pipeline and can be implemented independently of the world data limitations.

3. Implement a basic "Articulation" process:
   This could help in generating responses based on the internalized thoughts.

4. Create a simple "Contemplation" step:
   This could involve analyzing and refining the thought based on its current state.

Of these options, I recommend starting with the "Thinking" process, as it's central to your framework and can be prototyped quickly using existing tools. Here's how you might approach this:

1. Implement a basic "Think" step using an existing LLM:

```python
import openai

class Think(Pipeline):
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        super().__init__([self._think_step])
        openai.api_key = api_key

    async def _think_step(self, thought: dict) -> dict:
        prompt = f"Given the thought: '{thought['raw']}', and context: '{thought.get('context', '')}', please analyze and expand on this idea."
        
        response = openai.Completion.create(
            engine="text-davinci-002",
            prompt=prompt,
            max_tokens=150
        )

        thought['elaboration'] = response.choices[0].text.strip()
        return thought

# Usage in main pipeline
think_step = Think(api_key="your-openai-api-key")
main_pipeline = Pipeline([
    encode_input,
    Internalize([context_lookup, think_step, contemplate]),
    Articulate([think_step, formulate_response]),
    decode_output
])
```

This implementation uses OpenAI's GPT-3, but you could easily adapt it to use other LLMs or local models.

Challenges and Solutions:
1. API Costs: Start with a small number of API calls and gradually increase as you refine the process.
2. Latency: Implement caching for repeated thoughts or contexts.
3. Quality of Thinking: Iteratively refine your prompts to improve the quality of the LLM's responses.

Iterative Development Plan:
1. Implement basic "Think" step and integrate it into your pipeline.
2. Test with various inputs and analyze the results.
3. Refine the prompt and potentially add pre/post-processing steps.
4. Experiment with different LLMs or parameter settings.
5. Gradually introduce more complex thinking patterns (e.g., multi-step reasoning).

By starting with the "Thinking" process, you'll be able to see your Computational Thought Process in action, even without extensive world data. This will allow you to iterate on the core functionality of your framework and provide insights for further development.

Would you like to proceed with implementing this "Think" step, or do you have another component in mind that you'd prefer to focus on?
