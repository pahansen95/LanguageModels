I'm ready to start implementing µLM. I've identified a few high level goals:

- Build the initial µLM Architecture from the base Transformer Architecture. This will familiarzie me w/ the technology & then give me a basis to iterate from. I will use PyTorch as my DeepLearning Framework.
- Develop a Training Pipeline & Inference Pipeline for a µLM instance.
- Assemble Datasets to train the µLM with.
- Create a HTTP based API to provide decoupled access to the various pipelines & dataset assembly. Make it extensible so I can add more features & capabilities later.

   - Develop a modular training pipeline with configurable hyperparameters
   - Create an efficient inference pipeline optimized for consumer GPUs
   - Implement logging and evaluation metrics to track model performance

3. Dataset Assembly
   - Begin with existing datasets (WikiText, BookCorpus) as mentioned in the documentation
   - Develop data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines
   - Consider implementing a dataset versioning system for reproducibility

4. HTTP API Development
   - Design a RESTful API structure for training, inference, and dataset management

Certainly. I'll provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer architecture, including mathematical formulas and Python pseudo-code equivalents.

1. Overall Transformer Architecture

The Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple identical layers. The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence.

2. Input Embedding and Positional Encoding

Input tokens are first embedded into a continuous vector space. Since the Transformer doesn't use recurrence or convolution, positional encodings are added to provide information about the sequence order.

Math:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/dmodel))
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/dmodel))

Python pseudo-code:
```python
def positional_encoding(max_len, d_model):
    pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)
    position = torch.arange(0, max_len).unsqueeze(1)
    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2) * -(math.log(10000.0) / d_model))
    pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
    pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
    return pe
```

3. Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

The core of the Transformer is the multi-head attention mechanism. It allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.

Math:
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √dk)V

MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W^O
    where headi = Attention(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)

Python pseudo-code:
```python
def attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    d_k = query.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        self.query, self.key, self.value = [nn.Linear(d_model, d_model) for _ in range(3)]
        self.output = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        batch_size = query.size(0)
        query = self.query(query).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        key = self.key(key).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        value = self.value(value).view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)
        
        x = attention(query, key, value, mask)
        x = x.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(batch_size, -1, self.num_heads * self.d_k)
        return self.output(x)
```

4. Feed-Forward Networks

Each layer in the Transformer contains a fully connected feed-forward network.

Math:
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2

Python pseudo-code:
```python
class FeedForward(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, d_ff):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(d_model, d_ff)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(d_ff, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear2(F.relu(self.linear1(x)))
```

5. Layer Normalization and Residual Connections

Layer normalization is applied after each sub-layer, followed by a residual connection.

Math:
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))

Python pseudo-code:
```python
class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, d_ff, dropout):
        super().__init__()
        self.self_attn = MultiHeadAttention(d_model, num_heads)
        self.feed_forward = FeedForward(d_model, d_ff)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(d_model)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
    
    def forward(self, x, mask):
        attn_output = self.self_attn(x, x, x, mask)
        x = self.norm1(x + self.dropout(attn_output))
        ff_output = self.feed_forward(x)
        x = self.norm2(x + self.dropout(ff_output))
        return x
```

6. Output Layer

The final layer typically projects the decoder output to the vocabulary size and applies a softmax function to obtain probabilities.

Python pseudo-code:
```python
class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, src_vocab, tgt_vocab, d_model, num_heads, num_layers, d_ff, max_seq_length, dropout):
        super().__init__()
        self.encoder_embedding = nn.Embedding(src_vocab, d_model)
        self.decoder_embedding = nn.Embedding(tgt_vocab, d_model)
        self.positional_encoding = positional_encoding(max_seq_length, d_model)
        self.encoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([EncoderLayer(d_model, num_heads, d_ff, dropout) for _ in range(num_layers)])
        self.decoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([DecoderLayer(d_model, num_heads, d_ff, dropout) for _ in range(num_layers)])
        self.final_layer = nn.Linear(d_model, tgt_vocab)
    
    def forward(self, src, tgt, src_mask, tgt_mask):
        src = self.encoder_embedding(src) + self.positional_encoding[:src.size(1)]
        tgt = self.decoder_embedding(tgt) + self.positional_encoding[:tgt.size(1)]
        
        for encoder_layer in self.encoder_layers:
            src = encoder_layer(src, src_mask)
        
        for decoder_layer in self.decoder_layers:
            tgt = decoder_layer(tgt, src, src_mask, tgt_mask)
        
        return F.log_softmax(self.final_layer(tgt), dim=-1)
```

This overview covers the main components of the Transformer architecture. For the µLM implementation, you'll need to adapt this architecture, focusing on reducing the model size while maintaining performance. Consider techniques like pruning, quantization, or architectural modifications to achieve the target size of approximately 1GB.

Key takeaways: Modular structure, clear separation of components, and flexibility for future modifications.

Given your experience with PyTorch, I'll suggest a structured approach that allows for modularity and easy modifications for the µLM implementation. Here's a recommended file structure for `transformer.py`:

1. Import statements
2. Configuration class
3. Utility functions
4. Model components as separate classes
5. Main Transformer class

Here's a skeleton for `transformer.py`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import math

class TransformerConfig:
    """Transformer configuration."""
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model=512, nhead=8, num_encoder_layers=6,
                 num_decoder_layers=6, dim_feedforward=2048, dropout=0.1,
                 max_seq_length=5000):
        self.vocab_size = vocab_size
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.nhead = nhead
        self.num_encoder_layers = num_encoder_layers
        self.num_decoder_layers = num_decoder_layers
        self.dim_feedforward = dim_feedforward
        self.dropout = dropout
        self.max_seq_length = max_seq_length

def positional_encoding(max_len, d_model):
    # Implementation here

class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        # Implementation here

    def forward(self, query, key, value, mask=None):
        # Implementation here

class PositionWiseFeedForward(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        # Implementation here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implementation here

class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        # Implementation here

    def forward(self, x, mask):
        # Implementation here

class DecoderLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        # Implementation here

    def forward(self, x, memory, src_mask, tgt_mask):
        # Implementation here

class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__()
        # Initialize components here

    def forward(self, src, tgt, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):
        # Implementation here

    def encode(self, src, src_mask=None):
        # Encoding implementation

    def decode(self, tgt, memory, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):
        # Decoding implementation

# Utility functions for creating masks, etc.
def create_padding_mask(seq):
    # Implementation here

def create_look_ahead_mask(size):
    # Implementation here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Simple test to ensure the model compiles
    config = TransformerConfig(vocab_size=1000)
    model = Transformer(config)
    src = torch.randint(0, 1000, (64, 38))  # (batch_size, seq_len)
    tgt = torch.randint(0, 1000, (64, 36))  # (batch_size, seq_len)
    out = model(src, tgt)
    print(out.shape)
```

This structure offers several advantages:

1. Modularity: Each component is a separate class, making it easy to modify or replace parts of the architecture.
2. Configuration: The `TransformerConfig` class centralizes hyperparameters, making it easier to experiment with different configurations.
3. Flexibility: The main `Transformer` class can be easily subclassed to create variations for the µLM implementation.
4. Testability: The `if __name__ == "__main__"` block provides a quick sanity check to ensure the model compiles correctly.

As you implement each component, you can focus on optimizations and size reductions for the µLM. Consider techniques like:

- Using smaller dimensions for `d_model` and `dim_feedforward`
- Reducing the number of layers and attention heads
- Implementing more efficient attention mechanisms
- Exploring quantization techniques

Remember to add docstrings and comments to explain complex parts of the implementation, especially where you deviate from the standard Transformer architecture for µLM optimizations.

Would you like to start implementing any specific component, or do you need more details on any part of this structure?
