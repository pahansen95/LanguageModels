I'm attempting to Implement a basic Transformer Model using Pytorch; if you consult the Context you can see some current implementation & the original `Attention Is All You Need` WhitePaper. You helped me generate the current implementation in another conversation as well as understanding the Transformer Architecture more in-depth.

Right now though, I don't have a good grasp on the PyTorch Implementation. I think my knowledge gap is just how PyTorch works as a library. So in this conversation, I'd like to A) close my knowledge gap on PyTorch by stepping through each currently implemented core component of the Transformer Architecture, with a focus on ensuring I understand the implementation, it's goals & how PyTorch is fullfilling them.

Does my ask make sense or do you need me to answer any clarifying questions?

<meta hidden k=strat>
Context: User is implementing a Transformer model in PyTorch, has some existing code, and wants to understand PyTorch better.
Expectations: Detailed explanations of PyTorch implementation for each Transformer component.
Knowledge: Familiar with Transformer architecture, PyTorch basics, and tensor operations.
Key takeaways: PyTorch syntax, tensor operations, nn.Module usage, and how these relate to Transformer components.
Outline:
1. Confirm understanding of request
2. Offer to start with a specific component
3. Suggest systematic approach for reviewing each part

Your request makes perfect sense. You want to go through each implemented component of the Transformer, focusing on the PyTorch implementation details to bridge your knowledge gap with the library. This is an excellent approach to understanding both the Transformer architecture and PyTorch simultaneously.

To ensure we cover this effectively, I suggest we:

1. Start with a specific component (e.g., MultiHeadAttention, PositionalEncoding, etc.)
2. Examine the PyTorch code for that component
3. Explain the PyTorch-specific elements (e.g., nn.Module, tensor operations)
4. Relate the implementation back to the Transformer architecture concepts

Which component would you like to start with? Alternatively, we could begin at the top-level Transformer class and work our way down through its sub-components.
